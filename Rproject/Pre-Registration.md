#### *Disclaimer*

> This template is meant as an easy-to-use guided document that can be
used to get the elements of a project clear before finalizing a
registration (e.g., before ‘freezing’ a project on the Open Science
Framework \[OSF\]). This template describes the information that is
needed for a registration, and does not claim to be exhaustive. The aim
is to standardize pre-registrations, e.g., so researchers can find
relevant information in a structured way. Although using this template
does not guarantee that a journal, peer-reviewers, or a badge certifying
organization will accept the pre-registration, it is set-up to
ultimately satisfy this goal. The template is updated regularly to keep
up with the rapid developments in our field.

> Text descriptions should be as detailed (if not more) as a standard
description of procedures in a journal article. For questions or
suggestions to improve the template, please [contact Anna van ‘t
Veer](mailto:vantveer@gmail.com?subject=registration%20template).

#### *Short overview of steps for using the template*

> -   Register on OSF and create a project page there (see
      <https://osf.io/k5wns/files/> for instructions).
-   Complete this template and agree on the elements with your
      collaborators (the latest version of this template can always be
      found here: https://osf.io/k5wns/files/)
 -   Optional: Upload any necessary study materials to your project page
      (for instance: an exported document or .qsf from a Qualtrics
      survey). This step is optional and can also be done during or after
      registering (freezing) your project. If you do it after registering,
      the file will not be registered (you could upload the data to your
      project page after it is collected, for instance).
-   Register your project (see above-mentioned
      [instructions](https://osf.io/k5wns/files/))
-   Run your study
-   Include a link to the timestamped preregistration as part of your
      paper (see [instructions](https://osf.io/k5wns/files/))
-   Explain any deviations from the pre-registered methods and analyses
      in the paper
-   Make a clear distinction between confirmatory, a priori analyses and
      exploratory, post-hoc analyses not described in the pre-registration
      (for instance with two separate headings in your paper).

# Project working title:


## Authors:
> *leave this out for blind review of the pre-registration*

## Affiliation:
> *leave this out for blind review of the pre-registration*

## A. Hypotheses

>**Description of essential elements**
1.  Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of directional
    relationships between your (manipulated or measured) variables.
2.  For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the
    interactions.
3.  If you are manipulating a variable, make predictions for successful
    check variables or explain why no manipulation check is included.

> **Recommended elements**
1.  A figure or table may be helpful to describe complex interactions;
    this facilitates correct specification of the ordering of all group
    means.
2.  For original research, add rationales or theoretical frameworks for
    why a certain hypothesis is tested
3.  If multiple predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination,
    describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory.

## B. Methods

**Description of essential elements**

### Design

>List, based on your hypotheses from section A:
1.  Independent variables with all their levels
  - whether they are within- or between-participants
  - the relationship between them (e.g., orthogonal, nested).
2.  Dependent variables, or variables in a correlational design
3.  Third variables acting as covariates or moderators.

### Planned sample

>1.  If applicable, describe pre-selection rules.
2.  Indicate where, from whom and how the data will be collected.
3.  Justify planned sample size (if applicable, you can upload a file
    related to your power analysis here (e.g., a protocol of power
    analyses from G\*Power, a script, a screenshot, etc.).
4.  Describe data collection termination rule.

### Exclusion criteria

>Describe anticipated specific data exclusion criteria. For example:
-   missing, erroneous, or overly consistent responses
-  failing check-tests or suspicion probes
- demographic exclusions
- data-based outlier criteria
- method-based outlier criteria (e.g. too short or long response
    times)

### Procedure

>1.  (Recommended element, in the online form see next page) Set
    fail-safe levels of exclusion at which the whole study needs to be
    stopped, altered, and restarted. If applicable, you can upload any
    files related to your methods and procedure here (e.g., a paper
    describing a scale you are using, experimenter instructions, etc.).
2.  Describe all manipulations, measures, materials and procedures
    including the order of presentation and the method of randomization
    and blinding (e.g., single or double blind), as in a published
    Methods section.

## C. Analysis plan

### Confirmatory analyses

>Describe the analyses that will test each main prediction from the
hypotheses section. For *each one*, include:
1.  the relevant variables and how they are calculated
2.  the statistical technique
3.  each variable’s role in the technique (e.g., IV, DV, moderator,
    mediator, covariate)
4.  rationale for each covariate used, if any
5.  if using techniques other than null hypothesis testing (for example,
    Bayesian statistics), describe your criteria and inputs toward
    making an evidential conclusion, including prior values or
    distributions.

*(the online form asks the above for the first, second, third, fourth
and further predictions separately)*

>**Recommended elements**

>Specify contingencies and assumptions, such as:
1.  Method of correction for multiple tests.
2.  The method of missing data handling (e.g., pairwise or listwise
    deletion, imputation, interpolation).
3.  Reliability criteria for item inclusion in scale.
4.  Anticipated data transformations.
5.  Assumptions of analyses, and plans for alternative/corrected
    analyses if each assumption is violated.

> Optionally, upload any files here that are related to your analyses
(e.g., syntaxes, scripts, etc.).

**Answer the following final questions:**

Has data collection begun for this project?

If data collection has begun, have you looked at the data?
